I am an associate professor in the department of informatics, and an affiliate faculty member of both school of engineering and school of science, at Kyushu University in Japan. I am belonging to [the multi-agent laboratory](https://agent.inf.kyushu-u.ac.jp). My major research field is multi-agent systems, a subfield of artificial intelligence. More specifically, my research focuses on algorithmic aspects of mechanism design, including resource allocations and social choice. Further information on my research is found at
